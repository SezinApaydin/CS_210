# Personal Music Preferences Analysis

## Motivation

Understanding the evolution of personal music preferences over time can provide valuable insights into individual preferences and potential external influences. This project aims to explore and analyze my own music listening habits, with a particular focus on identifying patterns and shifts in genre preferences, especially during periods of midterms.

## Data Source

The primary source of data for this project is my personal Spotify listening history. To enhance the analysis, the 'Organize Your Music' website was used to classify songs by genre, as Spotify data alone lacked genre information. The resulting dataset was organized into an Excel file for further processing.

## Data Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning and Compilation
Spotify data was processed to extract relevant information, and the 'Organize Your Music' website facilitated the categorization of songs by genre, forming the basis of subsequent analyses.

### 2. Code Development
A custom code was created to read Spotify's JSON files, extract monthly most-listened songs, and match them with genre information from the Excel file. This automated approach streamlined the analysis process.

### 3. Visualization
Charts were generated to visually represent the distribution of genres in the most-listened songs each month, offering an intuitive understanding of the evolving patterns in music preferences.

## Findings

### 1. Monthly Genre Distribution
Patterns and variations in music preferences were identified, showcasing the diversity and consistency in genre choices over the months.

### 2. Influence of Midterms
During the months of November and December, coinciding with academic midterms, there were observable shifts in music preferences, suggesting a potential impact of external factors on listening habits.

## Limitations and Future Work

### 1. Limitations
The reliance on external websites for genre information introduced potential biases, and the subjective nature of genre classification posed challenges in achieving absolute accuracy.

### 2. Future Work
Future endeavors could involve refining the genre classification process, incorporating additional data sources, and exploring advanced analytical techniques. Additionally, considering external factors beyond academics may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics influencing music preferences.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of personal music preferences through a data-driven approach. The findings offer valuable insights into the evolution of music taste over time. Future plans include refining the methodology, exploring additional data sources, and incorporating more sophisticated analytical techniques for a deeper understanding of personal music preferences.
